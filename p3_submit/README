The psort.c code is a parallel quicksort approach using threads,
where the number of threads equal to the number of CPUs on the system else is set to 8.
The algorithm first reads the input file using mmap and stroes each record in a structure rec_t.
This algorithm works sequentially if records are less than 50.
When the records are more, the partition function of quicksort partitions the array according to 
the pivot and quicksort is recursively called.
When the records exceed 100,000 each thread sorts a block size of 64 * sizeof(rec_t) records 
followed by merging of records.
For the above algorithm we have referenced the paper:
